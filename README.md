# QuickFTpy

This version of the QuickFT library was modified to be built and used as a python extension.

The goal behind this project was to explore python extensions adapting a pre-existing library 
and turning it into a module.

For details on the protocol implementation please refer to the original QuickFT documentation.

Having read the original documentation, calling the python versions of the functions should
be trivial and self-explanatory.

In any case, I have also included sample scripts for client and server on how to use the library from python.
